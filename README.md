## Description

• This is the Refactored version of https://mcla1.herokuapp.com/ A website dedicated to teaching students with learning disabilities how to read using Morse code. This Version is still in refactoring stage and has expanded its game play into math.

• When completed this app aims to bridge the gap between general and
special education instrustional technology. Students with learning disabilities need instructional technology geared at their learning style and environment. This sentiment means that their learning will be unconventional, but that is exactly what MCLA is all about. MCLA focuses on taking the alphabet out of the equation and replacing that with two symbols and sounds, and using that association to build words.

## Technologies used

MCLA: React is currently being refactored with React, and with an additional math game.<br>
Main Technology:<br>
React, React-strap, Unity, Express, JQuery, mySQL, Heroku,<br>
• Tic tac toe <br>
Javascript & Jquery<br>
• The Code Collector<br>
Unity Game engine C# & Python AI ML API<br>
• Math Invaders(still under construction)<br>
Javascript

## How to play the games

<strong>MCLA has been upgraded to three games, two that focus on ELA and one on Mathematical skills.</strong>

<strong>#1 Morse Code Tic Tac Toe </strong> - Unconventional I know!<br>
• The point of this game is to play the computer for coded letters of a word and collect all the letters of the word before the computer to guess what the word is. When completed each coded letter will use text to speech feature so the player can associated morse code letter with alphabet sounds. This particular game focuses on blending letter sounds, building up executive function skills, such as organization, strategy and repeatition.

<strong>#2 The Code Collector </strong> Need for Morse Code Speed<br>
• The point of this game is to introduce kids to morse code symbol by symbol, by having students race around the track collects dots and dashes. As the game progresses they will be challenged to create letters with this dots and dashed they collected and eventually build up to spelling words. The aim is to get in first place while collecting the correct letters that will complete the word.

<strong>#3 Math Invaders </strong> <br>
• Inspired by Our childhood game Space Invaders, Math Invaders helps students practice basic math skills while being attacked by aliens. Students are given a number that they have to create by eliminating Aliens that calculate to that value. The game will start off with basic addition then progressively go into double and triple digits. Students will also have the choice of using subtraction and multiplcation.
