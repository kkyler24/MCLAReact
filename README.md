• This is the Refactored version of https://mcla1.herokuapp.com/ A website dedicated to teaching students with learning disabilities how to read using Morse code. This Version is still in refactoring stage and has expanded its game play into math.

• When completed this app aims to bridge the gap between general and
special education instrustional technology. Students with learning disabilities need instructional technology geared at their learning style and environment. This sentiment means that their learning will be unconventional, but that is exactly what MCLA is all about. MCLA focuses on taking the alphabet out of the equation and replacing that with two symbols and sounds, and using that association to build words.

<strong>MCLA has been upgraded to three games, two that focus on ELA and one on Mathematical skills.</strong>
